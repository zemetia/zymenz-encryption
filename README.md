# zymenz-encryption
Encryption that I made when I was in 10th-grade Senior HighSchool just with logic without Learning how to make a encryption
This encryption-encode will return different result when we run and encrypt a text everytime this is 100% random result with my own algoritm
BUT....
You can decode the ~random~ encryption and back into your origin-text

Of course my pen-name is Zymer not(zemetia) but Thought that it was very old since I in 1st-grade of Junior Highschool then I commit to change it just in GitHub
